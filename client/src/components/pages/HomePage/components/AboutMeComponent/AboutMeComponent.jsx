            Back in 2013, I helped my father build a website for a project he
            had in mind. It took me 3 sleepless nights to set up a site which
            would fail when seen in a different resolution (Who knew about media
            queries back then?). It has been 6 years since then and Iâ€™ve been
            hooked to the front end world. Still spending sleepless nights and
            still failing at new things.

            Work-wise, I work at a great company called
            <Link to="https://www.arm.com">Arm</Link> building complex web
            products for our customers. The React-based portal helps customers
            manage millions of devices across the globe. I spend my day writing
            features, unit-tests, a little bit of DevOps and giggling at a lot
            of Memes. I also know Kung-fu, Karate, Taekwondo and many other
            words.
